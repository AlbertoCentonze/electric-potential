# Visual representation of the electric potential field in a capacitor

The concept behind this project is that it's possible to obtain an approximation of the electric potential in a grid of nodes by averaging the potential of a node with the one of its neighbours.

This operation repeated for a good amount of iteration leads to interesting results like the one below.

## Why does the code look like garbage?

This is an old project of mine that I've been working on during high-school.

It's been discontinued for a long time and the code is rather primitive.

I'm trying to improve the code structure in my free time to make it look like it was made in this century.
